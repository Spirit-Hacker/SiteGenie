# ⚡ Site Genie

**Site Genie** is an AI-powered website generator that allows users to **build, customize, and deploy websites instantly** using natural language prompts.

It provides a **cloud-based development environment**, generates production-ready code, and enables real-time editing — similar to platforms like Bolty, but with deeper control and extensibility.
